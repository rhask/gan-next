        <h1>Zola + Cloudflare Pages</h1>
        <p>
          It's our goal to create a contextual, friction-free experience for our visitors.
          In order to accomplish this goal, we can leverage a slim stack of very powerful tools that
          serve to close the gap between marketing and web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, our web technology should serve to further our authority as a major player
          in compliance technology. We are not merely providing an industry-agnostic filing system;
          we offer tailored software with focused intelligence to best serve our clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zola creates the static portion of the page and Cloudflare Pages both delivers those pages
          via edge servers world-wide and injects location-based context and behavior. We can offer
          region-specific messaging pertinent to active and upcoming regulations and compliance concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is tremendous potential to leverage our current digital assets (e.g. country profiles)
          and develop other free tooling to provide value, generate demand, and build our mailable pool.
          <b>Here's a sample widget that uses a visitor's country code, searches for a matching country profile,
            and presents compliance details if a profile has been found.</b>

        <h1>Cloudflare Zaraz</h1>
        <p>
          Like Google's new server-sided tag management evolution, Cloudflare Zaraz executes client-side
          code on the server. This gives us very granular control over the flow of data (including PII)
          and allows us as a marketing team to participate in fully compliant practices without sacrificing
          functionality or analytic insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crucially, Zaraz will also circumvent tracking blockers. Many visitors block Google Tag Manager
          and Google Analytics from running in the browser. In fact, greater than 40% of visitors block
          any and all forms of tracking, creating a disparity in campaign attribution versus actual
          conversions and pipeline development. <b>Implementing Zaraz unlocks data from nearly all visitors,
            enables granular data compliance, and vastly decreases time to first contentful paint.</b>
